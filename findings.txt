Dicussions:
In order to rate the difficulty of the puzzles, I have kept track 
of the number of recursive calls required to solve each puzzle. The higher
the number of recursive calls the harder the puzzle.

The number of recursive calls for Mystery 1 puzzle is 400k+ and Mystery 3 puzzle is 14k+.
Therefore, it is deduced that Mystery 1 puzzle is harder than Mystery 3 puzzle. 

The position where the solve board function starts to solve the board and the
sequence of digit used to fill in the board has also been reversed and this has resulted
in different number of recursions required. On average, Mystery1 board still requires
the most number of recursions.
